Part 4:

	a) struct kernel_t ke;
		is the global variable that has the ctx's of all the process running in different states
		namely the part of the struct  context_list_head nad context_list_tail
	b) ctx->instr_slice variable in the struct ctx_t 
	c) Round Robin scheduling, every process has a instr_slice variable for which the process is executed, and then the next process in ke->running_lisst_head is executed
	look at function m2skernel.c:90:ke_run();
	this fucntions gives a hint about that process are exectuted one after other.
